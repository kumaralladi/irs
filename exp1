Aim: To Implement Representation of a Text Document in Vector Space Model and Computing Similarity between two documents.
Description:
Objective: To understand and implement how text documents can be represented numerically using the Vector Space Model (VSM).
To compute the similarity between two documents using measures like Cosine Similarity.
What is Vector Space Model (VSM)?
VSM is an algebraic model that represents text documents as vectors in a multi-dimensional space.
Each dimension corresponds to a unique term (word) in the corpus vocabulary.
The value in each dimension may represent raw frequency, TF (Term Frequency), or TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) score.
Why Vector Representation?
Enables application of mathematical and statistical operations like distance or similarity. Useful in information retrieval, document clustering, classification, and recommendation systems.
Cosine Similarity: Measures cosine of the angle between two vectors. Ranges from 0 (no similarity) to 1 (identical direction).


from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

doc1 = "Information retrieval is the process of obtaining relevant information from a collection of resources."
doc2 = "Text mining and information retrieval are important components of data science."

vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform([doc1, doc2])

similarity = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix[0:1], tfidf_matrix[1:2])

print("Cosine Similarity between doc1 and doc2:", similarity[0][0])


Cosine Similarity between doc1 and doc2: 0.23153213765661992
